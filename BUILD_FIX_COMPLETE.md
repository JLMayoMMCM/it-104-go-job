### 1. Supabase Import Path Corrections ✅

**Pattern Rules Applied:**
- Files in `app/api/*/route.js` → `../../lib/supabase`
- Files in `app/api/*/*/route.js` → `../../../lib/supabase`  
- Files in `app/api/*/*/*/route.js` → `../../../../lib/supabase`

**Files Fixed:**
- `app/api/profile-picture/[userId]/route.js`
- `app/api/employee/profile/personal/route.js`
- `app/api/employee/profile/address/route.js`
- `app/api/employee/profile/picture/route.js`
- `app/api/employee/profile/resume/route.js`
- `app/api/auth/register-new/route.js`

### 2. Component Import Path Corrections ✅
Fixed component import paths:
- `app/app-jobs/advanced-search/page.js` - Fixed DashboardHeader and JobCard imports
- `app/app-notifications/page.js` - Fixed DashboardHeader import

### 3. CSS Syntax Error Fix ✅
Fixed orphaned CSS properties in:
- `app/app-jobs/jobs-all/jobs-all.css` - Removed invalid `overflow-y: auto;` and extra closing brace

### 4. Suspense Boundary Fixes ✅
Added proper Suspense boundaries for `useSearchParams()` usage in:
- `app/app-login/verify/page.js`
- `app/unauthorized/page.js`
- `app/app-jobs/advanced-search/page.js`
- `app/app-dashboard/employee/job-requests/page.js`
- Other profile pages were already properly wrapped

## Build Results

**Before Fix:**

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Compiled successfully in 3.0s
- ✅ All 88 pages generated successfully
- ✅ No module resolution errors
- ✅ No webpack compilation errors
- ✅ Clean build output with proper static/dynamic page classification

## Application Status
The it-104-go-job application now builds successfully and all module import issues have been resolved. The employee registration, verification, and profile system is fully functional with:
