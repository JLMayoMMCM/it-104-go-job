# Registration System Completion Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Backend API Updates (register-new/route.js)
- **Profile Summary Integration**: Added `profile_summary` parameter to job seeker registration
- **Database Mapping**: Job seeker `profile_summary` now correctly saves to `job_seeker_description` field in database
- **Employee Registration**: Modified to use `company_id` instead of full company details
- **Company ID Validation**: Added validation to ensure provided company exists before employee registration
- **Username Support**: Added username field to registration process and account creation

### 2. Frontend Registration Flow (register/page.js)
- **2-Step Process**: Restructured registration into clear 2-step flow:
  - **Step 1**: User type selection only (Job Seeker, Employee, Company)
  - **Step 2**: Complete registration details based on selected type
- **Form Structure**:
  - Step 1: Only user type selection with Next button
  - Step 2: Account credentials + personal/company information + address
- **State Management**: Updated initial userType to empty string for proper step 1 selection
- **Validation**: Split validation into step-specific functions

### 3. Employee Registration Changes
- **Simplified Input**: Employees now only need to provide `company_id` instead of creating company details
- **UI Update**: Company information section replaced with simple Company ID input field
- **Help Text**: Added guidance for employees to contact their company administrator for Company ID

### 4. Form Field Updates
- **Username Field**: Added to both job seeker and employee registration in step 2
- **Account Credentials**: Moved email/password fields from step 1 to step 2 for personal accounts
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Step 1 focuses solely on user type selection

### 5. Backend Validation Updates
- **Username Validation**: Added username requirement for personal accounts
- **Company ID Validation**: Employee registration validates company_id instead of company_name
- **Account Creation**: Updated to use provided username or generate fallback
