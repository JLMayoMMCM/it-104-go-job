# Employee Verification Email System - Company Email Implementation

## Overview
Modified the employee registration system to send verification emails to the company email address instead of the employee's personal email address, providing enhanced security and centralized control over employee onboarding.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. New Email Function Created
**File**: `app/lib/emailService.js`
**Function**: `sendEmployeeVerificationToCompanyEmail()`

- Sends verification emails to company email instead of employee personal email
- Includes company branding and messaging
- Contains clear instructions for HR to forward verification code to employee
- Provides security warnings about unauthorized registrations

### 2. Registration Logic Updated
**File**: `app/api/auth/register-new/route.js`

Modified the email sending logic for employee registrations:

```javascript
if (user_type === 'employee' && companyInfo && companyInfo.company_email) {
  // Send employee verification email to company email instead of personal email
  await sendEmployeeVerificationToCompanyEmail(
    companyInfo.company_email, 
    email, 
    verificationCode, 
    userName, 
    companyInfo
  );
  console.log('Employee verification email sent to company email successfully');
} else if (user_type === 'employee' && companyInfo && !companyInfo.company_email) {
  // Fallback: if no company email, send to personal email with company branding
  await sendEmployeeVerificationEmail(email, verificationCode, userName, companyInfo);
  console.log('Employee verification email sent to personal email (no company email available)');
} else {
  // Standard verification for job seekers
  await sendVerificationEmail(email, verificationCode, userName);
  console.log('Standard verification email sent successfully');
}
```

## Email Flow Differences

### Employee Registration
1. **Recipient**: Company HR email (e.g., `contact@namsung.com`)
2. **Content**: 
   - Company-branded verification email
   - Employee details for HR review
   - Instructions for HR to forward code to employee
   - Security warnings about unauthorized registrations
3. **Process**: HR receives code → HR forwards to employee → Employee verifies

### Job Seeker Registration  
1. **Recipient**: Personal email address
2. **Content**: Standard GO JOB verification email
3. **Process**: Direct personal verification (unchanged)

## Security Benefits

1. **Company Control**: HR has oversight of all employee registrations
2. **Fraud Prevention**: Unauthorized employees cannot self-register
3. **Audit Trail**: Company email records provide registration tracking
4. **Centralized Management**: All employee verifications go through company channels

## Testing Results

### ✅ Employee Registration Test
- **Test Data**: John Employee, company_id: 1 (Namsung Corporation)
- **Result**: Verification email sent to `contact@namsung.com`
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS

### ✅ Job Seeker Registration Test  
- **Test Data**: Jane JobSeeker
- **Result**: Standard verification email sent to personal email
- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS (backward compatibility maintained)

## Email Template Features

### Company Email Template
- **Branding**: Company name prominently displayed
- **Clear Instructions**: Step-by-step guide for HR
- **Employee Info**: Name, email, registration date
- **Security Warnings**: Unauthorized registration alerts
- **Verification Code**: Prominent display for easy forwarding

### Fallback Handling
- If company has no email address: Falls back to personal email with company branding
- If company lookup fails: Falls back to standard verification
- Error handling ensures registration never fails due to email issues

## Database Requirements
No database schema changes required. Uses existing:
- `company` table (`company_email` field)
- `verification_codes` table
- Standard registration tables

## Configuration
Uses existing email configuration:
- SMTP settings from environment variables
- GO JOB email service infrastructure
- Standard 24-hour verification code expiration

## Files Modified
1. `app/lib/emailService.js` - Added `sendEmployeeVerificationToCompanyEmail()`
2. `app/api/auth/register-new/route.js` - Updated email sending logic

## Files Created for Testing
1. `test-employee-script.js` - Employee registration test
2. `test-jobseeker-script.js` - Job seeker registration test
3. `app/test-employee-email/page.js` - Browser test interface

## Future Enhancements
- Company dashboard to view pending employee verifications
- Bulk employee invitation system
- Integration with company HR systems
- Advanced permission controls for different HR roles
