# Company Registration Update - Email and Password Removal

## Summary
Successfully modified the registration system to remove email and password requirements for company registration, storing only address and company table data as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Updates (`/api/auth/register-new/route.js`)

#### Validation Changes
- **Removed email/password requirements for company registration**
- Modified validation logic to only require email/password for personal accounts (job-seekers and employees)
- Kept company name and city validation for company registration

#### Registration Flow Changes
- **Company Registration**: Now only creates records in `address` and `company` tables
- **Personal Registration**: Continues to create `account`, `person`, and specific role tables
- Removed account creation logic from `registerCompany` function
- Updated success messages to differentiate between company and personal registration

#### Database Operations
- **Company Registration**: Creates only `address` + `company` records
- **Personal Registration**: Creates `address` + `person` + `account` + role-specific records
- No authentication/account data stored for companies

### 2. Frontend Updates (`/app/app-login/register/page.js`)

#### Form Display Logic
- **Step 1**: Conditionally hides email and password fields for company registration
- Shows informational message for company users explaining no credentials needed
- Updated validation to skip email/password checks for companies

#### Validation Updates
- **Step 1**: Email/password validation only for non-company users
- **Step 2**: Removed company email requirement
- Made company email field optional with updated placeholder text

#### Submission Logic
- Modified `handleSubmit` to exclude email/password from company registration data
- Updated success messaging and routing for company vs personal registration
- Company registration redirects to home page, personal registration to verification

### 3. CSS Styling Updates (`/app/app-login/register/register.css`)

#### New Styles Added
- **Company info section**: Attractive gradient background with informational styling
- **Enhanced form elements**: Special styling for optional fields (dashed borders)
- **Success message styling**: Improved visual feedback
- **Animation enhancements**: Pulse animation for active user type selection

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints
- **Route**: `/api/auth/register-new` (POST)
- **Company Registration**: Requires only `user_type`, `company_name`, `city_name`
- **Personal Registration**: Requires email, password, and role-specific fields

### Database Tables Affected
- **Company Registration**: `address`, `company` tables only
- **Personal Registration**: `address`, `person`, `account`, `job_seeker`/`employee` tables

### Form Flow
1. **Step 1**: User type selection + credentials (if not company)
2. **Step 2**: Role-specific information + address data
3. **Submission**: Different data payloads based on user type

## Benefits
- **Simplified company onboarding**: No account creation barriers
- **Reduced friction**: Companies can quickly add themselves to directory
- **Maintained security**: Personal accounts still require full authentication
- **Clean separation**: Company listings vs user accounts properly distinguished

## Testing
- **Company Registration**: Tests creation of address and company records only
- **Personal Registration**: Maintains existing functionality with full account creation
- **Form Validation**: Properly handles different validation rules per user type
- **Success Flows**: Correct messaging and routing for each registration type

## Files Modified
1. `app/api/auth/register-new/route.js` - Backend registration logic
2. `app/app-login/register/page.js` - Frontend form and validation
3. `app/app-login/register/register.css` - Styling enhancements

## Verification
✅ Company registration works without email/password  
✅ Personal registration (job-seeker/employee) unchanged  
✅ Database records created correctly for each type  
✅ Form validation appropriate for each user type  
✅ Success messages and routing work correctly  
✅ UI/UX improved with better styling  

The registration system now successfully handles company registration as a simplified directory listing process while maintaining full authentication for personal user accounts.
