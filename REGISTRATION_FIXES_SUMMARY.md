# Registration System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Registration Input Requirements for Employees and Job Seekers

**Problem**: Form validation and API didn't match database schema requirements.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Updated validation to require first_name, last_name, phone, nationality_id for personal registrations
- Added address validation (city_name is required, other address fields optional)
- Enhanced API validation with proper error messages
- Added nationality validation to ensure selected nationality exists in database

**Files Modified**:
- `app/app-login/register/page.js` - Enhanced validation in `validateStep2()`
- `app/api/auth/register-new/route.js` - New API with proper schema compliance

### 2. ✅ Created 3rd Company Registration Option

**Problem**: Company registration existed but wasn't properly integrated with database schema.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Enhanced company registration form with all required fields
- Added address fields for company registration (premise_name, street_name, barangay_name, city_name)
- Improved company validation (company_name, company_email required)
